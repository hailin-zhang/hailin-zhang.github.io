      <h3> Junior Software Engineer </h3>
      <h5><i> 8 Month Co-op </i></h5>
      <p><strong> I'm currently working on the mobile team to develop and deploy our 3 mobile apps that are used around the world. </strong><br>
      Fatigue Science is a company that develops the Readiband, a SaaS-enabled wearable that tracks a user's actigraphy. Using the SAFTE algorithm developed by the United States Air Force over 20 years
      of research for over $40 million USD, it is able to predict the wearer's fatigue with a clinically proven 92% accuracy. Used by high performance athletes such as the Seattle Seahawks, the U.S. 
      Military, as well as industry workers such as truckers and construction workers across the globe, our mission at Fatigue Science is to make fatigue and sleep a manageable process, increasing productivity
      and reducing fatigue-related accidents. <br><br>
      As a member of the mobile team, I get to work firsthand with a variety of frameworks, languages, and technologies. Some of the ones I've interacted the most with in this role are: 
      <ul>
        <li> Typescript </li>
        <li> AngularJS up to Angular 6</li>
        <li> Ionic 1 up to Ionic 4 </li>
        <li> HTML, CSS, SCSS, Sass </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      You might notice that our mobile team doesn't follow the usual development strategies for mobile applications - instead, we're developing a hybrid app using the Ionic framework! 
      If you're not familiar, Ionic is a framework that uses Angular (and, more recently, many other libraries and frameworks) to access the native components of a mobile device. Because we're a relatively
      small and new startup, developing a hybrid application allows us to quickly deploy our code, as well as allowing us to easily manage our Android and iOS platforms simultaneously on a 
      single code base. I'm really excited about the future of Fatigue Science, and I'm hopeful that we can make a real difference in the world!

        <p> A Java program that parses any inputted text, and uses the MIT JWI to determine synonyms for words that have been used too often. It does this by using quicksort to sort the text alphabetically,
          and then determines if a word is a repeat if the next index is identical. There are much faster ways to approach this problem, but it was a good exercise in learning sorting algorithms.

          Lumohacks is a 24-hour Health-based hackathon that I attended over at SFU this year. With 3 of my friends, we created Project Shift:  A cross-platform service which enables patients suffering from substance 
          addiction/abuse to prevent triggers which cause their condition, alerting help if necessary. A smart watch application will respond to physiological triggers (i.e. heart rate, respiration, etc.), and if a 
          period of heightened stimulus is detected, signalling a trigger event, will vibrate for 5 seconds to ground the patient's thought stream and distract them. Then, it will open the mobile application, upon 
          which the patient is required to take a photo of the trigger event and/or what they are doing, which will be uploaded to a cloud server that is linked to our web application. Monitored by volunteers and/or workers 
          and family members, the photos will be validated manually, upon which an appropriate response is made: if approved, the trigger event will be marked as completed; otherwise, the patients' (previously inputted) contacts 
          are notified (i.e. family, close friends, coworkers, etc.), prompting them for a call or a text, escalating to a call to emergency services if there is no response. After the campaign is over, we plan on adding machine 
          learning components to our project, reducing the workload on manual labour by automatically detecting and verifying uploaded photos. Our <u><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ajwaYuySkz--sSPyGln5PEpAE_pHvhuGsR_tTUTfHvk/edit?usp=sharing">
