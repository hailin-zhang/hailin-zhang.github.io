        <h3> Junior Software Engineer </h3>
        <h5><i> 8 Month Co-op </i></h5>
        <p><strong> I'm currently working on the mobile team to develop and deploy our 3 mobile apps that are used around the world. </strong><br>
        Fatigue Science is a SaaS-enabled wearable that tracks a user's actigraphy, using the SAFTE algorithm developed by the United States Air Force over 20 years
        for over $40 million USD to predict the wearer's fatigue with a clinically proven 92% accuracy. Used by high performance athletes such as the Seattle Seahawks, the U.S. 
        Military, as well as industry workers across the globe, our mission at Fatigue Science is to make fatigue and sleep a manageable process, increasing productivity
        and reducing fatigue-related accidents. <br><br>
        As a member of the mobile team, I get to work firsthand with a variety of frameworks, languages, and technologies. Some of the ones I've interacted the most with in this role are: 
        <ul>
          <li> Typescript </li>
          <li> AngularJS up to Angular 6</li>
          <li> Ionic 1 up to Ionic 4 </li>
          <li> HTML, CSS, SCSS, Sass </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        You might notice that our mobile team doesn't follow the usual development strategies for mobile applications - instead, we're developing a hybrid app using the Ionic framework! 
        If you're not familiar, Ionic is a wrapper for Angular (and, more recently, many other web-based APIs) to access the native components of the mobile device. Because we're a relatively
        small and new startup, developing a hybrid application allows us to quickly deploy our code, as well as allowing us to easily manage our Android and iOS platforms simultaneously on a 
        single code base. I'm really excited about the future of Fatigue Science, and I'm hopeful that we can make a real difference in the world!
